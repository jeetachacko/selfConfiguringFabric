# Self Driving Blockchain System

This repository contains the research artifacts for a scientific paper submission. 

The three branches in the repo correspond to the prototype implementation of three locally autonomous systems. Clone the appropriate branch and run `python3 scf_fab.py` to train the model.

The scripts to setup the Fabric network and generate the workloads are available at [HyperledgerLab Repo](https://github.com/jeetachacko/hll3_opennebula/tree/main). 

The trained models are available at [Trained Models](trainedModels).
